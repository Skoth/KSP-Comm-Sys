# KSP Communications Engineering Mod

This mod is designed to provide an educational approach to the topic of engineering satellite communications, but through the same simplified abstractions that KSP uses to teach rocket science. It is in no way a competitor nor alternative to existing mods related to satellite communications. This mod focuses more on the design of communications systems from the view of both the ground station and the remote satellite. The communication channel becomes realized once both the ground station and the satellite have synchronized communication systems.

Planned features include:
* Frequency allocation setup before launch
* Modulation scheme design for specific environments
* Antenna radiation patterns and power dissipation
