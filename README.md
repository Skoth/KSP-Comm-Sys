# KSP Communications Engineering Mod

This mod is designed to provide an educational approach to the field of satellite communications, but through the same simplified abstractions that KSP uses to teach rocket science. It is in no way a competitor nor alternative to existing mods related to satellite communications. This mod focuses more on the ground station internals needed to establish a communication channel.

Planned features include:
* Frequency allocation setup before launch
* Modulation scheme design for specific environments
* Antenna radiation patterns and power dissipation
